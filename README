The present set of files includes python code to deal with data from
automatic meteorological stations. The code performs a quality control
on the data and prepare using the Pandas library a data frame with the
different fields of interest.

The code has been applied to meteorological data from the town of
Huelva (Spain) from a station located in the roof of the Facultad de
Ciencias Experimentales in the University of Huelva.

Part of this job has been done by Mr. Fernando Domínguez-Garzón as his
"Trabajo fin de grado" (bachelor's degree thesis) during the second
semester of the academic year 2014-2015.
